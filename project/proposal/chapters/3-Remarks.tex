\section{Concluding Remarks}

This project proposal outlines a comprehensive approach to exploring the
potential of various deep learning architectures in the challenging domain of
underwater object recognition. By leveraging Python and powerful deep learning
libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, alongside the interactive capabilities of
Jupyter Notebooks, this study aims to compare the efficacy of established models such as CNNs and ResNets, as well as investigate the emerging potential of Transformer models in this context.

A significant focus of this project will be on the pre-processing of images,
as the quality and clarity of underwater images can significantly impact
the performance of deep learning models.
Techniques such as image enhancement, noise reduction, and color correction are
expected to play a crucial role in improving the accuracy and robustness
of object recognition.

The insights gained from this project will contribute to a deeper understanding
of the strengths and limitations of different deep learning approaches in underwater
environments.
