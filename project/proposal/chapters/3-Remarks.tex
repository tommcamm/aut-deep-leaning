\section{Concluding Remarks}

This project proposal outlines a comprehensive approach to exploring the
potential of various deep learning architectures in the challenging domain of
underwater object recognition.
By using Python with the capabilities of TensorFlow, PyTorch,
and the interactive environment of Jupyter Notebooks, this study aims to not
only compare the efficacy of established models such as CNNs and ResNets but
also investigate the emerging potential of Transformer models in this context.

This project could potentially contribute to the field of marine biology,
archaeological exploration and autonomous underwater navigation by identifying
optimal deep learning strategies that can help with the unique challenges
posed by the underwater environments.
