% Abstract
\abstract{
    This project proposal aims to investigate the efficacy of various deep learning
    architectures in the specialized field of underwater object recognition,
    which has significant implications for marine biology, archaeological exploration, and autonomous underwater navigation.
    Underwater environments pose unique challenges such as low lighting, unclear images, and complex backgrounds,
    necessitating robust solutions.

    This project will conduct a comparative analysis of deep learning models
    including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Residual Networks (ResNets),
    and Transformer models to determine the most effective strategies for accurate
    and efficient object recognition in underwater scenarios.

    Using Python and by using popular deep learning libraries such as
    TensorFlow and PyTorch, the project will implement and train these models.
    The methodology involves a comprehensive evaluation of model performance,
    focusing on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score,
    and computational efficiency under various underwater conditions.

    The expected outcomes include identifying the optimal deep learning
    architectures that can effectively address the challenges of underwater imaging.
