% Abstract
\abstract{
    This project proposal investigates the efficacy of various deep learning
    architectures in the specialized field of underwater object recognition,
    a critical area of research with significant implications for marine
    biology, archaeological exploration, and autonomous underwater navigation.
    Recognizing the unique challenges posed by underwater environments such as
    low lighting, unclear images, and complex backgrounds.
    This project aims to perform a comparative analysis of various deep learning
    models and architecture like Convolutional Neural Networks,
    Residual Networks and Transformer models to find the most
    effective strategies for accurate and efficient object recognition in the
    underwater realm.

    By using Python as the primary programming language, the project will use
    popular deep learning libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch, for model
    implementation and training.
    The methodology focuses on a comprehensive evaluation of model performance,
    assessing accuracy, precision, recall, and computational efficiency under
    varying underwater conditions.
    
    Expected outcomes include identifying optimal deep learning architectures
    that overcome the inherent challenges of underwater imaging.
