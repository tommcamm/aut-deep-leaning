  abstract = {We present a new method that views object detection as a direct set prediction problem. Our approach streamlines the detection pipeline, effectively removing the need for many hand-designed components like a non-maximum suppression procedure or anchor generation that explicitly encode our prior knowledge about the task. The main ingredients of the new framework, called DEtection TRansformer or DETR, are a set-based global loss that forces unique predictions via bipartite matching, and a transformer encoder-decoder architecture. Given a fixed small set of learned object queries, DETR reasons about the relations of the objects and the global image context to directly output the final set of predictions in parallel. The new model is conceptually simple and does not require a specialized library, unlike many other modern detectors. DETR demonstrates accuracy and run-time performance on par with the well-established and highly-optimized Faster R-CNN baseline on the challenging COCO object detection dataset. Moreover, DETR can be easily generalized to produce panoptic segmentation in a unified manner. We show that it significantly outperforms competitive baselines. Training code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr.},

  abstract = {Underwater object detection is an essential step in image processing and it plays a vital role in several applications such as the repair and maintenance of sub-aquatic structures and marine sciences. Many computer vision-based solutions have been proposed but an optimal solution for underwater object detection and species classification does not exist. This is mainly because of the challenges presented by the underwater environment which mainly include light scattering and light absorption. The advent of deep learning has enabled researchers to solve various problems like protection of the subaquatic ecological environment, emergency rescue, reducing chances of underwater disaster and its prevention, underwater target detection, spooring, and recognition. However, the advantages and shortcomings of these deep learning algorithms are still unclear. Thus, to give a clearer view of the underwater object detection algorithms and their pros and cons, we proffer a state-of-the-art review of different computer vision-based approaches that have been developed as yet. Besides, a comparison of various state-of-the-art schemes is made based on various objective indices and future research directions in the field of underwater object detection have also been proffered.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the potential of vision-based object detection algorithms in underwater environments using several datasets to highlight the issues arising in different scenarios. Underwater computer vision has to cope with distortion and attenuation due to light propagation in water, and with challenging operating conditions. Scene segmentation and shape recognition in a single image must be carefully designed to achieve robust object detection and to facilitate object pose estimation. We describe a novel multi-feature object detection algorithm conceived to find human-made artefacts lying on the seabed. The proposed method searches for a target object according to a few general criteria that are robust to the underwater context, such as salient colour uniformity and sharp contours. We assess the performance of the proposed algorithm across different underwater datasets. The datasets have been obtained using stereo cameras of different quality, and diverge for the target object type and colour, acquisition depth and conditions. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been experimentally demonstrated. Finally, object detection is discussed in connection with the simple colour-based segmentation and with the difficulty of tri-dimensional processing on noisy data.},

  abstract = {We propose a deep convolutional neural network architecture codenamed "Inception", which was responsible for setting the new state of the art for classification and detection in the ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2014 (ILSVRC 2014). The main hallmark of this architecture is the improved utilization of the computing resources inside the network. This was achieved by a carefully crafted design that allows for increasing the depth and width of the network while keeping the computational budget constant. To optimize quality, the architectural decisions were based on the Hebbian principle and the intuition of multi-scale processing. One particular incarnation used in our submission for ILSVRC 2014 is called GoogLeNet, a 22 layers deep network, the quality of which is assessed in the context of classification and detection.},

  abstract = {Underwater object detection is one of the most challenging research topics in computer vision technology. The complex underwater environment makes underwater images suffer from high noise, low visibility, blurred edges, low contrast and color deviation, which brings significant challenges to underwater object detection tasks. In underwater object detection tasks, traditional object detection methods often perform poorly in terms of accuracy and generalization capabilities. Underwater object detection requires accurate, stable, generalizable, real-time and lightweight detection models, for which many researchers have proposed various underwater object detection techniques based on deep learning. Although many outstanding results have been achieved on underwater object detection over the years, the research status of underwater object detection techniques are still lack of unified induction, and some existing problems need to be further probed from the latest perspective. In addition, previous reviews lack analysis on the relationship between underwater image enhancement and object detection. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive review of the current research challenges, future development trends, and potential applications of underwater object detection techniques. More importantly, this paper has explored the internal relationship between underwater image enhancement and object detection, and analyzed the possible implementation manners of underwater image enhancement in the object detection task in order to further enhance its benefits. The experiments show the performances of current underwater image enhancement and state-of-the-art object detection algorithms, point out their limitations, and indicate that there is not a strict positive correlation between underwater image enhancement and the accuracy improvement of object detection. The domain shift caused by underwater image enhancement cannot be ignored. This paper can be regarded as a guide for future works on underwater object detection.},
