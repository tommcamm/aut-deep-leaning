\section{Literature Review}
Underwater object recognition has been subject of increasing interest in the
scientific community,  driven by the increasing number of
potential application in areas such as marine biology, underwater archeology
and autonomous underwater navigation.

\subsection{Deep Learning in Underwater Object Recognition}
Deep learning has significantly advanced the field of computer vision,
surpassing the capabilities of traditional object detection methods that
relied on hand-crafted features for image classification.
Initial endeavors predominantly employed Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs), used for their proficiency in automatically learning
and adapting spatial hierarchies of features from
images \parencite{zhiqiangReviewObjectDetection2017}.
For underwater detection CNN were used successfully to recognize objects with
significant accuracy, managing to work against the challenges of low-quality
images \parencite{hanUnderwaterImageProcessing2020}

\subsection{Advancements and Architectural Innovations}
Following the success of CNNs, more sophisticated architectures
like Residual Networks (ResNets) have been introduced, allowing training on
deeper networks by addressing the vanishing gradient problem 
\parencite{heDeepResidualLearning2016}.
ResNets have demonstrated remarkable performance in general object recognition
tasks, yet their efficiency and adaptability in underwater conditions remain
an area of active research.

The advent of Transformer models, originally designed for natural
language processing tasks, has been adapted for computer
vision \parencite{hanSurveyVisionTransformer2023}.
These models, which rely on self-attention mechanisms, offer a new
approach to handling the spatial relationships in images,
potentially offering advantages in complex underwater scenes where context
and object relationships are important.

\subsection{Challenges in Underwater environments}
Recognizing objects underwater presents unique challenges not typically
encountered in terrestrial environments.
Factors such as variable lighting conditions, water turbidity, and the
presence of particulates can significantly impact the performance of deep
learning models \parencite{liUnderwaterImageEnhancement2020e}.
Studies have begun to explore the robustness of different architectures under
such conditions, emphasizing the need for models that can adapt to or correct
for these environmental distortions.

\subsection{Comparative Analyses in the Literature}
Comparative studies specifically addressing the performance of deep learning
architectures in underwater object recognition are sparse but growing.
These studies are crucial for understanding the practical limitations and
opportunities of applying these advanced computational models to underwater
scenarios.
For instance, a study by \Textcite{tengUnderwaterTargetRecognition2020}
compared the accuracy and computational efficiency of CNNs
and ResNets in identifying underwater mines,
highlighting the trade-offs between model complexity and recognition
performance.
